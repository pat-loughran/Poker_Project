# Poker_Project
Welcome to Patrick's Poker Player! A java based Texas Hold'em style poker simulator.

I started this project after I learned about Object Oriented Programming and my friends and I started moving our monthly poker games online from the pandemic.
The core of this project is not the UI (which is text based) or the poker bots (which are psuedo-random) but rather to show competence in larger multi-class projects that runs a complex driver program correctly.

I created a video to showcase the project and you can watch it here!

If you're new to poker, having someone who knows how to play around can help to undertsand the program or if you'd like to check it out here's a link.

Good Luck!
